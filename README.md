DP6037 Bus Pirate Case
======================

A case made for the Bus Pirate v3.6 (and other Bus Pirates that are DP6037 compatible). 
[Look here](http://open.konspyre.org/blog/2012/12/31/3d-printed-bus-pirate-case/) to 
see what it looks like when printed.

## Which top do I choose?

If using a fancier than usual printbed (borosilicate glass, metal, etc), use the
-axis-flipped.stl file so that the top facing side is printed as flatly as
possible.

In reality, either file works well; but blue printer tape users may find the
-top-usb.sl file more worthwhile if their blue tape tends to stick (and not come
off) to prints.

So in summary:

Using blue tape? -top-usb.stl
Have a really fancy printbed? -axis-flipped.stl
