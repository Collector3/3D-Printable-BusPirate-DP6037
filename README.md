DP6037 Bus Pirate Case
======================

A case made for the Bus Pirate v3.6 (and other Bus Pirates that are DP6037 compatible). 
[Look here](http://open.konspyre.org/blog/2012/12/31/3d-printed-bus-pirate-case/) to 
see what it looks like when printed.

## Which top file do I choose?

If using a fancier than usual printbed (borosilicate glass, metal, etc), use the
-axis-flipped.stl file so that the top facing side is printed as flatly as
possible.

In reality either file works. However, users of blue tape (for printbeds) may find the
-top-usb.stl file more worthwhile if their print tends to stick (and not come
off cleanly) to the blue tape.

So in summary:

Using blue tape? -top-usb.stl
Have a really fancy printbed? -axis-flipped.stl

## Assembly

There are a bunch of ways to assemble the case, but this seems to be the best way (so far):

* 4x M3 screws
* 4x M3 hex nuts

Ordering (from bottom to top): M3 head, bottom plate, Bus Pirate PCB, M3 hex nut, top plate.

The top plate screws in from the bottom.
